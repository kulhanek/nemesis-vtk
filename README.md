# NEMESIS - Molecular Modelling Environment
Nemesis is an advanced molecular structure builder. It is able to build a
molecule from predefined 3D fragments. Molecules can be visualized in
monoscopic and stereoscopic representations. The geometry of the built
molecule can be easily measured and manipulated.

This is an attempt to use VTK as a graphics engine instead of plain OpenGL.

## Documentation
The documentation is available [here](https://nemesis.ncbr.muni.cz).

## Building Package
The building and installation procedure can be found in the
[nemesis-vtk-build](https://github.com/kulhanek/nemesis-vtk-build) repository.
